# Simple Bracket Compiler

## Overview
This is the first project of my Programming Languages class in Ball State. In this project, I made a C program to parse through a file and determine if the parentheses in the file were valid based on the rubric. This program also ignores parentheses that are inside of a string or inside of a short or long comment. I coded this in a remote Linux machine using Vim, but copied them unto my computer and then pushed them to GitHub for safe keeping. 

## Key Features
- Validates Parentheses based on specified criteria
- Ignores parentheses within strings or comments

## Technologies Used
- **C**: Programming Language used for the implementation.
- **Vim**: To write and refactor code on a remote Linux device.

## Special Thanks
The credit for the test files goes to professor Jennifer Coy.
