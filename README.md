# Simple Bracket Compiler

## Overview

This is the first project of my Programming Languages class in Ball State. In this project, I made a C program to parse through a file and determine if the parentheses in the file were valid based on the rubric. This program also ignores parentheses that are inside of a string or inside of a short or long comment. I coded this in a remote Linux machine using Vim, but copied them unto my computer and then pushed them to GitHub for safe keeping. 

## Key Features

- Validates Parentheses based on specified criteria
- Ignores parentheses within strings or comments

## Installation

1. Clone the Repository: `git clone https://github.com/tsnicholas/SimpleCompiler.git`
2. Navigate to the Project Directory: `cd SimpleCompiler`
3. Run the executable: `./a.out input_file.txt` where "input_file.txt" is the path to any file you want to input.

## Technologies Used

- **C**: Programming Language used for the implementation.
- **Vim**: To write and refactor code on a remote Linux device.

## Special Thanks
