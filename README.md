# SimpleCompiler

This is the first project of my Programming Languages class in Ball State. In this project, I made a C program to parse through a file and determine if the parentheses in the file were valid based on the rubric. This program also ignores parenthesis characters that are inside of a string or inside of a short or long comment. I coded this in a remote Linux machine using Vim, but copied them unto my computer and then pushed them to GitHub for safe keeping. The credit for the test files goes to my professor, Jennifer Coy.
